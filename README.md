# VectorSage

VectorSage is a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) application that uses a vector database to provide context-aware answers to user questions. It features a real-time chat interface for a seamless user experience.

## Core Features

-   **Chat UI**: A clean and responsive chat interface with a scrollable message history, an input box, and a loading indicator.
-   **Question Embedding**: Generates an embedding for the user's question using the OpenAI Embeddings API (`text-embedding-3-small`).
-   **Weaviate Query**: Queries a Weaviate vector database using the embedding to retrieve the most relevant context.
-   **Answer Generation**: Passes the retrieved context and the user's original question to OpenAI's GPT-4o to generate a context-aware answer.
-   **Citation Display**: Displays the answer with clickable citations that link back to the original sources, providing transparency and trust.
-   **Clear Chat**: Allows users to easily clear the chat history and start a new conversation.
-   **Health Check Endpoint**: Includes a health check endpoint to monitor the status of the OpenAI and Weaviate connections.

## Technical Stack

-   **Framework**: Next.js
-   **AI/ML**: Google AI Studio (Genkit)
-   **Language Model**: OpenAI GPT-4o
-   **Embedding Model**: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`
-   **Vector Database**: Weaviate
